## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a real-time automated pet feeding system using ESP32 firmware written in C++.  

It enables:

- Remote feeding via web interface  
- Scheduled feeding with NTP time synchronization  
- Deterministic motor actuation  
- ML-assisted portion logic using TensorFlow.js
